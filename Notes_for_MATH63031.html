            <p><strong>Theorem 1.1.</strong> If $a$ and $b$ are any numbers, then there is one and only one number $x$
                such that $a+x=b$. This number $x$ is given by $x=b+(-a)$.<br />
                <strong>PROOF</strong>. We must establish two results (i) that $b+(-a)$ satisfies the equation $a+x=b$
                and (ii) that no other number satisfies this equation. To prove (i), suppose that $x=b+(-a)$. Then,
                using Axioms A-2 through A-4 we see that $a+x=a+[b+(-a)]=a+[(-a)+b]=[a+(-a)]+b=0+b=b$.
                Therefore (i) holds. To prove (ii), suppose that $x$ is some number such that $a+x=b$. Adding $(-a)$ to
                both sides of this equation, we find that
                $$(a+x)+(-a)=b+(-a).$$
                Now,
                $$(a+x)+(-a)=a+[x+(-a)]=a+[(-a)+x]=[a+(-a)]+x=0+x=x.$$
                We conclude that $x=b+(-a)$, and the uniqueness of the solution is established. $\square$

                $$(a+c)+(b+d)=(a+b)+(c+d).$$<br />
                PROOF. Using Lemma 1.1 and the axioms, we have
                $$(a+c)+(b+d)=[(a+c)+b]+d=(a+c+b)+d$$
                $$=(a+b+c)+d=[(a+b)+c]+d=(a+b)+(c+d). \square$$</p>
            <p><strong>Theorem 1.2</strong>
                (i) If $a$ is a number, then $-(-a)=a.$
                (ii) If $a$ and $b$ are numbers, then
                $$-(a+b)=(-a)+(-b).$$
                <strong>PROOF</strong>. (i) From the definition of negative, we have
                $$(-a)+[-(-a)]=0, (-a)+a=a+(-a)=0$$
                Axiom A-5 states that the negative of (-a) is unique. Therefore, $a=-(-a)$. To establish (ii), we know
                from the definition of negative that
                $$(a+b)=[-(a+b)]=0.$$
                Furthermore, using Lemma 1.2, we have
                $$(a+b)+[(-a)+(-b)]=[a+(-a)]+[b+(-b)]=0+0=0.$$
                The result follows from the "only one" part of Axiom A-5. $\square$

            <p><strong>Theorem 1.3.</strong> If $a$ is any number, then $a*0=0$.<br />
                <strong>PROOF.</strong> Let $b$ be any number. Then $b+0=b$, and therefore $a(b+0)=ab$. From the
                distributive law (Axiom D), we find that
                $$(ab)+(a*0)=(ab),$$
                so that $a*0=0$ by Axiom A-4. $\square$

                frequently in mathematics, requires some explanation. Suppose $A$ and $B$ stand for propositions which
                may be true or false.</p>
            <p>To say that $A$ is true if $B$ is true means that the truth of $B$ implies the truth of $A$. The
                statement $A$ is</p>
            <p>Note: Make a footnote here</p>
            <p><strong>Theorem 1.5.</strong>
                (i) We have $ab=0$ if and only if $a=0$ or $b=0$ or both.<br />
                (ii) We have $a\ne0$ and $b\ne0$ if and only if $ab\ne0$.<br />
                <strong>PROOF.</strong> We must prove two statements in each of Parts (i) and (ii). To prove (i),
                observe that if $a=0$ or $b=0$ or both, then it follows from Theorem 1.3 that $ab=0$. Going the other
                way in (i), suppose that $ab=0$. Then there are two cases: either $a=0$ or $a\ne0$. If $a=0$, the result
                follows. If $a\ne0$, then we see that
                $$b=1*b=(a^{-1}a)b=a^{-1}(ab)=a^{-1}*0=0.$$
                Hence $b=0$ and (i) is established. To prove (ii), first suppose $a\ne0$ and $b\ne0$. Then $ab\ne0$,
                because $a\ne0$ and $b\ne0$ is the negation of the statement "$a=0$ or $b=0$ or both." Thus (i) applies.
                For the second part of (ii), suppose $ab\ne0$. Then $a\ne0$ and $b\ne0$ for, if one of them were zero,
                Theorem 1.3 would apply to give $ab=0$. $\square$

            <p><strong>Lemma 1.3.</strong> If, $a$, $b$, and $c$ are numbers, then
                $$abc=acb=bac=bca=cab=cba.$$
                <strong>Lemma 1.4</strong> If $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are numbers, then
                $$(ac)*(bd)=(ab)*(cd)$$
                <strong>Theorem 1.6.</strong>
                (i) If $a\ne0$. then $a^{-1}=0$ and $[(a^{-1})^{-1}]=a$.<br />
                (ii) If $a\ne0$ and $b\ne0$, then $(a*b)^{-1}=(a^{-1})*(b^{-1})$.<br />

            <p><strong>Theorem 1.7.</strong> If $a$ and $b$ are any numbers, then

                (ii)$(-a)*b=-(a*b)$<br />
                (iii)$(-a)*(-b)=a*b$<br />
                <strong>PROOF.</strong> (i) Since $b+(-b)=0$, it follows from the distributive law that
                $$a[b+(-b)]=a*b+a*(-b)=0.$$
                Also, the negative of $a*b$ has the property that $a*b+[-(a*b)]=0$. Hence we see from Axiom A-5 that
                $a*(-b)=-(a*b)$. Part (ii) follows from Part (i) by interchanging $a$ and $b$. The proof of (iii) is
                left to the reader. $\square$
            </p>
            <p><strong>Corollary.</strong> The equality $(-1)*a=-a$ holds.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Notation.</em> We introduce the following symbols for $a*b^{-1}$:
                $$a*b^{-1}=\frac{a}{b}=a/b=a\div b.$$
                These symbols, representing an indicated division, are called <strong>fractions</strong>. The
                <em>numerator</em> and <em>denominator</em> of a fraction are defined as usual. A fraction with
                <em>denominator</em> zero has no meaning.<br />
                <strong>Theorem 1.8</strong><br />
                (i) For every number $a$, the equality $a/1=a$ holds.<br />
                (ii) If $a\ne0$, then $a/a=1$.<br />
                <strong>PROOF.</strong> (i) We have $a/1=(a*1^{-1})=(a*1^{-1})*1=a(1^{-1}*1)=a*1=a$. (ii) If $a\ne0$.
                then $a/a=a*a^{-1}=1$, by definition. $\square$
            </p>
            <p><strong>Theorem 1.9</strong> If $b\ne0$ and $b\ne0$, then $b*d\ne0$ and
                $$(\frac{a}{b})*(\frac{c}{d})=\frac{a*c}{b*d}.$$
                <strong>PROOF.</strong> That $b*d\ne0$ follows from Theorem 1.5. Using the notation for fractions, Lemma
                1.4, and Theorem 1.6(ii), we find
                $$(\frac{a}{b})*(\frac{c}{d})=(a*b^{-1})*(cd^{-1})=(a*c)*(b^{-1}d^{-1})=(a*c)(bd)^{-1}=\frac{a*c}{b*d}.$$
                $\square$
            </p>
            <p><strong>Theorem 1.10</strong><br />
                (i) If $b\ne0$ and $c\ne0$, then
                $$\frac{a}{b}=\frac{a*c}{b*c}.$$
                (ii) If $c\ne0$, then<br />
                $$\frac{a}{c}+\frac{b}{c}=\frac{(a+b)}{c}.$$
                (iii) If $b\ne0$, then $-b=0$ and
                $$\frac{-a}{b}=\frac{a}{-b}=-(\frac{a}{b}).$$
                (iv) If $b\ne0$, $c\ne0$, and $d\ne0$, then $(c/d)\ne0$ and
                $$\frac{(a/b)}{(c/d)}=\frac{a*d}{b*c}=(\frac{a}{b})*(\frac{d}{c}).$$

            <p><strong>Definitions.</strong> The set (or collection) of all real numbers is denoted by $\R^{1}$. The set
                of ordered pairs of real numbers is denoted by $\R^{2}$, the set of ordered triples by $\R^{3}$ and so
                on.<br /></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Relation:</strong> A <strong>relation</strong> <em>from</em> $\R^{1}$ <em>to</em> $\R^{1}$
                    is a set of ordered pairs of real numbers, that is, a relation from $\R^{1}$ to $\R^{1}$ is a set in
                    $\R^{2}$.<br /></li>
                <li><strong>Domain:</strong> The <strong>domain</strong> of this relation is the set in $\R^{1}$
                    consisting of all the first elements in the ordered pairs.<br /></li>
                <li><strong>Range:</strong> The <strong>range</strong> of the relation is the set of all the second
                    elements in the ordered pairs. Observe that the range is also a set in $\R^{1}$.<br /></li>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> A function $f$ <em>from</em> $\R^{1}$ into $\R^{1}$ is a relation in
                    which no two ordered pairs have the same first element. We use the notation $f: \R^{1} \rightarrow
                    \R^{1}$ for such a function.<ul>
                        <li><strong>Mapping:</strong> The word <strong>mapping</strong> is a synonym for function. If
                            $D$ is the domain of $f$ and $S$ is its range, we shall sometimes use the notation $f: D
                            \rightarrow S$. A function is a relation (set of $\R^{2}$) such that for each element $x$ in
                            the domain there is precisely one element $y$ in the range such that the pair $(x,y)$ is one
                            of the ordered pairs which constitute the function. Occassionally, a function will be
                            indicated by writing $f: x \rightarrow y$. Also, for a given function $f$, the unique number
                            in the range corresponding to an element $x$ in the domain is written $f(x)$. The symbol $x
                            \rightarrow f(x)$ is used for this relationship. We assume that the reader is familiar with
                            functionL notation.</li>

                <li><strong>Sequence:</strong> A <strong>sequence</strong> is a function which has as its domain some or
                    all of the natural numbers. If the domain consists of finite number of positive integers, we say the
                    sequence is <strong>finite</strong>. Otherwise, the sequence is called <strong>infinite</strong>.

            <p><strong>Proposition 1.5.</strong> The sum of a finite sequence can be obtained by separating the given
                sequence into several shorter sequences, adding the terms in each of these, and then adding the results.
                A similar statement holds for products.<br />
                <strong>Proposition 1.6.</strong> The sum of a given finite sequence is independent of the order of its
                terms. The product of a funeute sequence is independent of thr order of its terms.<br />
                <strong>Proposition 1.7.</strong> If $a$ is any number and $b_1,b_2,...,b_n$ is any sequence, then
                $$a*(b_1+b_2+ \cdots + b_n)=(b_1+b_2+ \cdots + b_n)*a=ab_1+ab_2+ \cdots +ab_n.$$

                    (i) $(a+b)+c=a+(b+c)$ and $(a*b)*c=a(b*c)$ for all $a$,$b$,$c\in k$ (associativity).<br />
                    (ii) $a+b=b+a$ and $a*b=b*a$ for all $a,b,c \in k$ (commutativity).<br />

                <p><strong>Remarks:</strong> The fields most commonly used in the text are $\Q$, $\R$, and $\C$. In the
                    exercises to $\S$1 of Chapter 1, we mention the field $\F_2$ which consists of the two elements 0
                    and 1. Some more complicated fields are discussed in the text. For example, in $\S$3 of Chapter 1,
                    we define the field $k(t_1,...,t_m)$ of rational functions in $t_1,...,t_m$ with coefficients in
                    $k$. Also, in $\S$5 of Chapter 5, we introduce the field $k(V)$ of rational functions on an
                    irreducible variety $V$.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cayley tables are used to describe the structure of finite groups by
                arranging all the possible group's element into square tables with a single operator. In example for the
                Cayley multiplaction table, the operator is the multipler, and the elements of the group are align
                alongside the top and left boundaries of the table.<br />
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate Cayley tables and the process of which is used to describe a
                group's structure, we will consider a syetem with five elements $0$,$1$,$2$,$3$,$4$:</p>
